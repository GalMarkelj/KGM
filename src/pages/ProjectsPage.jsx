          In primary school I was all about gaming, that's way I enrolled in computer high school. First 3 years I was an electrician beacuse I didn't have enough points to enter a computer program. In primary school I was very lazy when it comes to studying, I was always out playing or doing some 'silly' things. Everything started when I finished 3th year and switched the program and become a computer guy. The school wasn't the best soo I started to work all days and I was barely in school, but when I was, I was sleeping. Because of that I fell all my exams about programming. I also took some instructions, I was also thinking to change school. But then my family said 'once you start running away from your challenges, you will never stop', then I started to study. My will for programming started to grow and I graduated from my program and become a computer technician.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="f--xl">üéì</span>
          After that I enrolled into higher school of informatics, only enrolled, I was still working as an electrician because I thought 'who would want to take some kid for development with zero experience'. This school had condition to complete practical education. To find a good company to take me in I stated to study and making my first project to show some will and where my knowledge lies. That was my first upload on github,

        </div>
        <p className="m-top--m">
          <span className="f--xl">üè¢</span>
          I found a company who were willing to take me in for my practical education and said, if I work hard and study enough they will employ me. Here I am now, creating this website as a project to learn React and to tell my story how my journey started.

      My plan in the future is to continue further into the deep of the back-end.
